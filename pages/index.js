Sure, I'll initialize a simple Next.js project by creating the `pages/index.js` file. This file will serve as the main entry point for our task list application. Here is the detailed documentation followed by the code for the `index.js` file:

```javascript
/**
 * @file index.js
 * @description This file is the main entry point for the Next.js application. It renders the homepage, 
 *              which will serve as the task list application.
 * 
 * @module pages/index
 * 
 * @exports Home
 * 
 * @requires react
 * 
 * @functions
 * @function Home - Renders the main homepage for the task list application.
 * 
 * @returns {JSX.Element} - A React element that represents the main homepage.
 * 
 * @example
 * import Home from './index';
 * 
 * const App = () => (
 *   <div>
 *     <Home />
 *   </div>
 * );
 * 
 * export default App;
 */

// Importing necessary modules
import React from 'react';

/**
 * Home component
 * 
 * @function Home
 * @returns {JSX.Element} - A React element that represents the main homepage.
 */
const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Your Task List</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Task 1</li>
        <li>Task 2</li>
        <li>Task 3</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

This code initializes a simple Next.js application with the main entry page displaying a header and a sample task list. You can further modify and extend this file as needed to develop your task list application.

Certainly! Let's set up the basic configuration for a Convex project by creating a configuration file named `setupConfig.tsx`. This file will be responsible for setting up the initial configuration for the Convex backend.

Here's how the file will look:

```typescript
/**
 * Convex Configuration Setup
 * 
 * This file is responsible for setting up the Convex configuration
 * for the backend services. This file includes functions to:
 * - Connect to the Convex project using a project-specific URL.
 * - Set up initial configurations essential for the backend services.
 *
 * @file setupConfig.tsx
 *
 * @function initializeConvex
 * @description Initializes the connection to Convex backend.
 *
 * @returns {void}
 * 
 */

import { ConvexClient } from 'convex/react';

// Replace 'your-convex-url' with your actual Convex project URL.
const CONVEX_URL = 'your-convex-url';

// Initialize the Convex client
export const initializeConvex = () => {
  // Create a new Convex client instance
  const convexClient = new ConvexClient(CONVEX_URL);
  
  // Log success message
  console.log('Convex client initialized successfully');
  
  // Additional configuration can be done here
};

initializeConvex();
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Header Documentation:**
   - **Purpose**: This section explains the overall purpose of the file, which is to set up the configuration for Convex.
   - **Functions**: Detailed description of the functions included in the file.
   - **Arguments**: Arguments each function takes (if any).
   - **Returns**: What each function returns.

2. **Code Implementation:**
   - **import { ConvexClient } from 'convex/react';**: Import the `ConvexClient` from Convex library.
   - **CONVEX_URL**: A constant that holds the URL of your Convex project. This should be replaced with the actual URL of your Convex project.
   - **initializeConvex Function**: This function creates an instance of the `ConvexClient` with the provided Convex URL and logs a message upon successful initialization. Additional configuration settings can be added as needed.

3. **Function Call:**
   - `initializeConvex()`: Invoke the `initializeConvex` function to set up the initial configuration.

Remember to replace `'your-convex-url'` with the actual URL provided by your Convex project. Save this file, and your backend setup for Convex should be initialized correctly.
